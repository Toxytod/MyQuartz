### Business Plan
#### Context
In Italy from the middle school to the end of the high school (3+5 years) the family is financially responsible for the expences on school books; per scholar per year those are exitmated to be 481€ ([Federconsumatori](https://www.federconsumatori.it/scuola-per-ogni-ragazzo-si-spenderanno-mediamente-57160-euro-per-il-corredo-scolastico-43-rispetto-al-2021-e-48104-euro-per-i-libri/) quoted by [Sole24Ore](https://alleyoop.ilsole24ore.com/2022/09/13/scuola-spese/?refresh_ce=1)). This value is result of the average of _new_ books from schools of all sorts: middle school, tecnici and licei. Buying used books decreases the costs by 24% (ibid.) even though this isn't possible for many students who are required to buy the newest editions. The expences for new books have increased yoy by 4.3% due to the well-known inflation trends.
Almost all books come in both the digital and the paper version: the former is of increasing importance due to digitalisation trends and the pandemic forced students and teachers to familiarise with those more than ever. The digital version comes in the form of a unique code that can be used to see and edit the book through the app offered by the editor for one device only. The paper version is still the most used by students in class and is still seen as necessary by most teachers and students.
#### Business Idea
An increasing number of scholars%%(data)%% daily uses Tablets and Laptops as a crucial, if not the only, material for productivity, just like it already is for any university student. On the other hand, there certainly are those that prefer to have the feeling of the paper, it certainly is a personal matter. Both students though, if they buy new, receive _two_ books, the paper version and the digital version, since they are always sold together. This abundance creates an opportunity for the digital-affine students to buy the codes for the online version only from those other students that wouldn't use it anyway.
My business idea is to let this offer and demand for codes for school books meet through an online store. It is crucial to consider that the fee can increase deliberately high, the student who bought a book for 30€ would be happy to have 10€ back for the code they wouldn't use, on the other hand, the digital-affine student (who cannot find any online version in the used market) would be happy to buy the digital version for 20€.
#### Foreseeable Expenses
Despite the potentially very high fees, there is no substantial investment needed. All that divides the exposed idea from its realisation is a website. No logistics will ever be needed, since all that has to be moved are codes of school books, no physical thing. For more on the structure of the website see [[TestiOnline#Step 2. The Website]].
For an overview on how these expenses will be covered, visit [[Finance & Investments]].
##### Two Business Models
There are two different business models with different expenses expectations:
###### They Buy, They Sell
This is the budget one, the seller makes a post with his book and the buyer contacts them through my website. My job would then be to guarantee that the code has not been used already and I would therefore get a fee for the purchase in the store.
This business model lowers margins and, more improtantly, makes a worse user experience: the seller needs to make a post for every code in the hope that someone will buy them and the seller needs to search those in the website considering different offers for the exact same sort of code (since he will be searching for the only one ISBN that is required by the school).
On the other hand, this enables me not to invest anything more than what is required to build the platoform where you can buy and sell those books.
###### I Buy, I Sell
This buisness model requires a little higher constant risk, since it requires me to choose which books I want to buy by the sellers by my own company founds and then sell them through the website to the buyers. This machanism avoids any difficulty for both buyer and seller, since transaction can happen immediately: I will alredy know which books I want to buy and which to refuse, hence the seller will see directly from the website whether I will or will not buy his book and the transaction will happen immediately. On the other hand the buyer will find one result per ISBN at a fixed price, which now I am free to choose, like the my purchase price from the seller.
This model requires me to accept the risk that some book will be bought and never sold, though, starting with a short list of considered books, will considerably lower this risk. On the other hand I must also find the right balance between buyers and sellers, a too high amount of sellers will could cause me to have more codes than I can sell. Therefore, by controlling buying and selling price, I must control the amount of books I buy and those that I sell so that the number of transaction is maximised (for the first period this may be more important than the total income in fees).
##### Client Assistance
For the first time any sort of questions will be directly answered per Email by me, I will then consider to hire someone responsible for it.

##### Commercialista
There might be the necessity to hire a financial adivisor from when I start accepting the very first transactions, for more see: [[TestiOnline#Need of a Commercialista Before Beginning]].
#### Market Analysis
For computing the total market cap I consider the total amount of euros spent by families in Italy for student per year times the total number of students which amounts to 450€ times 7.400.000 students ([La Stampa](https://www.lastampa.it/cultura/scuola/2021/10/19/news/scuola-in-numeri-10-dati-che-fotografano-l-anno-2021-22-1.40827505/)), 3.330,00 Mi. €. Since revenue comes by transaction that involves two students, I half the number: 1.665,00 Mi. €. For a fee in percentage of $x \in (0,1)$ and a percentage $y \in (0, 1)$ of the market cap that goes through the website, we get that the annual revenue will be equal to $1.665,00 \cdot x \cdot y$ Mi. €. In order to give an example, consider the example where one euro over 100 passes through the website ($x = 0, 01$) and that I have a fee of 10% on every purchase ($y = 0.1$) this makes an annual revenue of $1,665,000$€.
To understand how these numbers may change due to macroeconomical changes, read [[TestiOnline#Macroeconomical Influences]].
To see a list of possible competitors and all the most relevant players in the market, read [[TestiOnline#Competitors]].
#### Competitors
Since there is no similar business, the following are not competitors in the sense that their business is in any way similar to mine, instead I mean that those companies would have a loss derived by my success.
##### Editors
Any book that is sold by my platform is a book that they don't sell. On the other hand it is essential that I can check whether the codes I want to buy are new or already used (and therefore worth nothing), in order to do so, I will need to check them in the editors websites, for more on this issue read [[TestiOnline#Check Codes Validity]].
###### Feltrinelli
##### New Books Market Places
Just like editors, every book I sell, is one they don't. Furthermore they are the only option that studens have to get the online version on books. Also conside that those market places often have competing prices with the used market and are thereofore, together with the editors, those that would loose more from my success.
###### Coop
##### Used Books Market Places
As alredy shown, the student seeking for the online version only, won't find it in the used market, though the student in search of the cheapest option, will consider to have the online version only on a cheap iPad instead of buying used books at a price only 24% lower than the new one ([Federconsumatori](https://www.federconsumatori.it/scuola-per-ogni-ragazzo-si-spenderanno-mediamente-57160-euro-per-il-corredo-scolastico-43-rispetto-al-2021-e-48104-euro-per-i-libri/)).
If we compare the expenses for used books at around 330€ with the expenses of online books (say at half the price) plus a cheep iPad in fact we get a better experience (for some students) for a perhaps a lower price. If we consider 350€ on a new cheap iPad together with an all books at 200€ (instead of 330€), only three years will suffice to start making the digital option the cheapest, for more on how this concept will be spread read [[TestiOnline#Cheapest]].

### Steps twoards Realisation
Here are precise and concrete steps to be followed to make the presented idea real.
#### Step 1. Legal Issues
First of all I need to be sure that all what I want to do is legal. In order to do so, a specialised financial advisor (the Italian Commercialista) will certainly be needed, a usual Commercialista not specialised in this area will not have the required legal competence. Up to now I didin't manage to find someone competent in the area, though the company [La Legge Per Tutti](https://consulenze.laleggepertutti.it/consulenza?id_aut=27&id_relpost=172479#) offers a written consulence for 80€, furhtermore they showed competence in the area in the article [È Legale Vendere o Comprare Libri Usati?](https://www.laleggepertutti.it/172479_e-legale-vendere-o-comprare-libri-usati) and also [Si Può Rivendere un eBook?](https://www.laleggepertutti.it/350109_si-puo-rivendere-un-ebook).
##### Advises From [La Legger Per Tutti](https://www.laleggepertutti.it/)
I first need to state questions precisely in a PDF document, below you find the $\LaTeX$ code that generates this PDF. Below you will find the answers.
###### Questions
``` LaTeX

```
###### Answer
##### Need of a Commercialista Before Beginning
I need to consider among the expenses (see [[TestiOnline#Foreseeable Expenses]]) the necessity to hire a Commercialista from when I start accepting transaction since there might be complicated financial and administrative issues with taxes and registrations.
#### Step 2. The Website
Making the right website will require at most the following three components:
##### Guide and Introductory Website
%%Just like a Blog, in Quartz.%%
###### Guide to Buy&Sell
###### Cheapest
##### iPad Advises
##### Payment Platform 

##### Backend Database

##### Technical Issues
###### Check Codes Validity
#### Step 3. Moral Advertising
##### Target
%%Both parents and students, who wants to spend less and who want to be tech.%%
### Appendix
#### Macroeconomical Influences
Here I list the consequences I can forsee of different macroeconomical situations.
##### Interest Rates Influence
Since the very low expenses ([[TestiOnline#Foreseeable Expenses]]) there will be no debt and interest rates will not affect negatively the business. The possibility to hire someone responsible for client assistance ([[TestiOnline#Client Assistance]]) will be under a regime of positive cashflow and absence of debt. Since high interest rates have a strong correlation with high inflation, read: [[TestiOnline#Inflation's Influence]].
##### Inflation's Influence
Since there is no material to be bought nor correlated expenses, inflation would only increase the expenses relative to client assistance [[TestiOnline#Client Assistance]]. On the other hand the total market cap would increase (see [[TestiOnline#Market Analysis]]), as it did in 2022, by 4.3% ([[TestiOnline#Context]]).
Considering that Italian wages increase at a way slower rate than inflation%%data%% and that client assistance would make a little expense and proportional to the annual transaction (and hence to the revenue), inflation would only have a positive effect on the company.
If the reader is now worried about the interest rates that usually follow high inflation, read [[TestiOnline#Interest Rates Influence]].
##### Recession
A recession would not prevent parents to buy school books for their children, though, they might start looking for the cheapest option (see [[TestiOnline#Cheapest]]). Since, arguably, the website will present the cheapest option, one can only forsee an higher number of transactions.


#### Similar Businesses
I don't know of any company that is on most aspects similar to the concept described, though, there certainly are comapnies that are very similar in some aspects, here those companies are listed.
##### ToGoodToGo
The company [TooGoodToGo](https://www.toogoodtogo.com/it) is a company similar in two aspects in particular: it sells what is worthless to the sellers and sells it for very low prices. Its model is very close to [[TestiOnline#They Buy, They Sell]], it connects those shops that have meals or pasteries that could not be be sold after the day and those people that would buy them for cheap just before closing time. It has also the advantage that it does not need any sort of logistics. It is clear why the model [[TestiOnline#I Buy, I Sell]] would not be better.
It is also similar in its way to advertise (see [[TestiOnline#Step 3. Moral Advertising]]), it underlines how their business help to decrease sensibile food waste.
##### Lush
The company [Lush](https://www.lush.com/it/en) sells soaps and any cosmetic product and an essential component of its branding clearly is their commitment against pollution, waste, global warming, animal testing ecc... I want [[TestiOnline#Step 3. Moral Advertising]] to be a similar manner of adveritising, since, as Lush shows, it is very successful on young people which, partially, are the target (read [[TestiOnline#Target]]).
