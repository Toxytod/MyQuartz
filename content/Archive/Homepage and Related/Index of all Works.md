Here one finds connections to my works, first I list some that I enjoyed most and which I consider being the most important. After that a full list in a thematic division follows and then one in chronological order.
Here one can also find the list of all completed courses together with marks and details on how they are counted for the final mark at the LMU: [[Marks LMU.pdf]].
