### School Years
After school I moved to Switzerland by my father, I went to [Liceo Vermigli](http://liceo-vermigli.com/), an Italian private school in Zurich. For various reasons, I preferred to go to the swiss cantonal school, therefore I improved my German, from A1 to B2.
The two year after I have been a student at the [Swiss Cantonal School in Baden](https://www.kanti-baden.ch/). By the half of the second year, I began to feel uncomfortable there too, my desire to study more rigorously humanities grew and both because of unavoidable linguistic issues and the technical essence of the Swiss School, I considered moving back to Italy.
Then, I spent the year after back to Genoa, my aim was to get in the [Liceo Classico A. D'Oria](https://liceodoria.edu.it/) where I could have satisfied all my humanistic desires, though, since there were too many subjects I din't have in the swiss school, I spent the first year in Genoa at [Liceo Scientifico Cassini](https://www.liceocassini.it/). In order to get there I passed an exam on six different subjects that I didn't have in Switzerland.
After studying ancient greek in the summer, I finally got into the Liceo Classico where I spent my fifth and last year of high school studies, I passed the final exam with 96/100 [[Liceo Final Mark.pdf]].

### Early University Years
I spent my first year of university at the [University of Constance](https://www.uni-konstanz.de/) officially registered in B.A. in Philosophy but practically following all courses of the BSc in Mathematics too. The professors I got closest too are: [Leon Horsten](https://www.philosophie.uni-konstanz.de/horsten/leon-horsten/) and [Sam Roberts](https://www.philosophie.uni-konstanz.de/en/ag-leon-horsten/members-of-the-ag-horsten/academic-staff/sam-roberts/) in analytical philosophy and [Mateusz Micha≈Çek](https://www.mathematik.uni-konstanz.de/working-group-real-geometry-and-algebra/prof-dr-mateusz-michalek/) in Algebra.
I am currently in my third semester at the LMU Munich and plan to finish the degree in the next semester (by the end of August 2024) in both BSc. Mathematics and BA Philosophy. I spent some time discussing with [John Dougherty](https://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/people/faculty/dougherty_john/index.html) the topics present in [[Thesis]].
I recently started to spend little time on my entrepreneurship project: [[TestiOnline]].
