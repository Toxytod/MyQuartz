In the course on Philosophy of Logic by [Dr. A. Marra](https://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/people/faculty/marra_alessandra/index.html) I will submit an essay on mathematical models and possible worlds. For context see [[Thesis]].
###### Abstract
The Tarskian definition of logical consequence requires to consider models within the same formal system of any proposition that we want to prove true. I then expose how the Tarskian Truth definition applied to any sort of empirical sentence requires an analysis of possible worlds as models. I then consider the question, on which one is the formal language of worlds, showing the connection with the literature on logical pluralism.
